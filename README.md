  # Valo XP Fam

  A tool that farm ur XP on Valorant if u not currently playing or lazy like me.
  
  For Nerds:

  I used multiple APIs to simulate the mouse and keyboard hits. So Valo think ur a human.
  Normaly u cant use Third-Party Software but it worked.
  
  
  
  
# Tutorial ðŸŒ 
  Its easy just download the tool and make sure u disabled the windows defender because sometimes the tool will deleted or mark as a virus but it's not. After you complete the download open valorant and the tool at least.

  <b>
  I will publish the tool first in German but dont worry i work on the english version.
  If the Version is out u will see a update announcement on the programm.
